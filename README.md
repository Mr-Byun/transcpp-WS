# transcpp-WS

This is a modification of Reinitz Lab transcription model (K. A. Barr, Implementation of the Reinitz lab transcription model, (2016), Github repository, https://github.com/kennethabarr/transcpp).

Two extra modes have been implemented to allow users to add binding sites (score and K value) manually to the model.

Read xml in /fits for more information.
